Get ready to learn about the wild world of line feed and carriage return, the dynamic duo of text formatting! You might think they're just boring old control characters, but oh boy, do they have a story to tell.

Back in the day, typewriters ruled the roost and **CR** (Carriage Return) and **LF** (Line Feed) were their trusty sidekicks. **CR would whisk the cursor back to the beginning of the line**, while **LF was all about that downward mobility** – it’d take the cursor to the next line, no questions asked.

But then came the dawn of computing, and these characters had to adapt to survive. CR and LF teamed up to become the **ASCII end-of-line sequence**, which was used across the board. It was a classic case of teamwork making the dream work.

Of course, not everyone was happy with this arrangement. Different operating systems started to do their own thing, with **Unix using only LF** and **Macintosh using only CR**. It was like a sports rivalry between two teams, with Unix and Macintosh each using their own end-of-line format.

But don’t worry, because a hero emerged to save the day: the **CRLF** sequence. It’s the universal end-of-line sequence that brings all systems together and ensures compatibility, just like the Justice League but for text files.

In **Windows-based systems**, a new line is represented by the sequence of two characters: CR followed by LF (i.e., `\r\n`). In contrast, in **Unix and Linux systems**, a new line is represented by a single character LF (i.e., `\n`).

So there you have it, the history of line feed and carriage return in all its fun and crazy glory. Who knew a couple of control characters could be so damn interesting?
