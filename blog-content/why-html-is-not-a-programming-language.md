HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language widely used in web development to structure web pages, define their content and layout, and establish their relationships with other web resources. Although HTML has some scripting capabilities, it is not considered a programming language.

## **What is Turing completeness?**

Turing completeness is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the ability of a system to perform any computation that a Turing machine can. A Turing machine is a theoretical model of a computer that can simulate any algorithmic computation. A Turing-complete system can, therefore, simulate any algorithm that can be computed by a Turing machine.

## **Turing completeness in programming languages**

Languages like Python, Java, and C++ are Turing-complete because they can perform any computation that can be expressed as an algorithm. They can implement complex data structures, manipulate data, and control program flow using loops, conditionals, and functions.

## **Why is HTML not a programming language?**

In contrast, HTML is a markup language that is designed primarily for defining the structure, content, and appearance of web pages. Although HTML does provide some limited scripting capabilities, it lacks the expressiveness and flexibility of a Turing-complete language.

HTML scripts can only perform simple tasks, such as modifying the appearance of web pages or validating user input. They are not capable of performing complex computations or implementing complex data structures. They also cannot manipulate external resources or interact with the operating system. Therefore, while HTML is an essential language for web development, it is not a programming language.

## **Conclusion**

The concept of Turing completeness is crucial in computer science for assessing the limits of computational power. HTML is not Turing-complete and, therefore, is not considered a programming language. While HTML is used for structuring web pages, it is not capable of performing arbitrary computations like a Turing-complete language such as Python or Java.
